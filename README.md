# Library-Management-Web-Application

CLIENT: Librarian
Library contains more than 30,000 books. My client has been a librarian for more than 15 years. The library is functioning in offline mode. 

OBJECTIVE: 
I have to develop a portal. Automate the entire library, whatever is possible for: 
Add a book entry; delete a book entry
Book issue
Book returns (including late fine, lost book, damaged book cases)
New user registration
Search feature to search books
Monthly/Yearly log list of all the books issued and returned
Journal Section

New features: (that my client has seen are shortcomings of current software used in Rajasthan in other libraries)
Update a book entry
Monthly and yearly list of books that are newly purchased.
List of books that are out of stock or pending to be returned.


This model is based on my client's requirements on what all he wants to do on a software that will manage the ongoing process in a much smoother way.
