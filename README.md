# Library-Management-Web-Application

CLIENT: Librarian  <br />
Library contains more than 30,000 books. My client has been a librarian for more than 15 years. The library is functioning in offline mode.  <br />

OBJECTIVE:  <br />
I have to develop a portal. Automate the entire library, whatever is possible for:  <br />
Add a book entry; delete a book entry <br />
Book issue <br />
Book returns (including late fine, lost book, damaged book cases) <br />
New user registration <br />
Search feature to search books  <br />
Monthly/Yearly log list of all the books issued and returned <br />
Journal Section <br />

New features: (that my client has seen are shortcomings of current software used in Rajasthan in other libraries) <br />
Update a book entry <br />
Monthly and yearly list of books that are newly purchased. <br />
List of books that are out of stock or pending to be returned. <br />


This model is based on my client's requirements on what all he wants to do on a software that will manage the ongoing process in a much smoother way.
